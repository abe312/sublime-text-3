# sublime-text-3
sublime configurations themes, emmet, package manager and more..

A simple way to convert vanilla sublime to something much more...
*You'll have to install sublime text 3 first*

*Edit*
-get package control from here: https://packagecontrol.io/installation
-just copy stuff inside Packages/User/* (it contains all these packages and themes which packagecontrol will install for you)

##For windows 
*copy the contents in:*

`C:\\Users\$USER\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3`

##For Ubuntu
*copy the contents in:*

`/home/$USER/.config/sublime-text-3/`
or simply `~/.config/sublime-text-3`

##For Mac
*open terminal and copy the contents after the next step*

`open /Users/$USER/library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3`



Note: $USER = your user name in the OS :)
*an easy way to check the folder to paste the contents would be open sublime 3 and then => Preferences => Browse Packages*

The only folders important for getting all the stuff are
* Packages
* Installed Packages

Build version I'm currently using: Build 3126

Another way you may simply `git clone` from terminal in those folders and all the contents would be copied.

These settings for sync come as is and nothing can be claimed in case the software doesn't works as its supposed to..

Windows `C:\\Users\$USER\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3`

Ubuntu  `~/.config/sublime-text-3`

Mac `/Users/$USER/library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3`

**`git clone https://github.com/abe312/sublime-text-3`**

And done..
Cherios!
