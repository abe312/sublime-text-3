# sublime-text-3
sublime configurations themes, emmet, package manager and more..

A simple way to convert vanilla sublime to something much more...
*You'll have to install sublime text 3 first*

##For windows 
*copy the contents in:*

`C:\\Users\$USER\AppData\Roaming\Sublime Text 3`

##For Ubuntu
*copy the contents in:*

`/home/$USER/.config/sublime-text-3/`
or simply `~/.config/sublime-text-3`

##For Mac
*open terminal and copy the contents after the next step*

`open /Applications/Sublime\ Text.app/Contents/MacOS`



Note: $USER = your user name in the OS :)
*an easy way to check the folder to paste the contents would be open sublime 3 and then => Preferences => Browse Packages*

The only folders important for getting all the stuff are
* Packages
* Installed Packages

Build version I'm currently using: Build 3126

Another way you may simply `git clone` from terminal in those folders and all the contents would be copied.
